            <h3>STORIES</h3>
            <div class="story piece">
                <p class="title">Amazaballs!</p>
                <p class="date">Nov 2014</p> 
                <p>“You’re strange.”</p> 
                <p>“What?”</p> 
                <p>“You’re strange!”</p> 
                <p>“Why am I strange?”</p>
                <p>“I don’t know. Your aspects. Everything about you is strange! Come, come, come, meet my friend!” she said with a shimmy and a purr as she dragged me by my hand from the lamppost I was leaning on towards the gateway to Grand Central, her diamond bracelets jingling as she moved. I hastily tucked my iPod into the pocket of my fatigue jacket, my May subway playlist still shuffling and faintly emanating from my headphones. “This is Karen, she’s amaaaaazaballs! You should see her house in Westchester, it’s positively diviiiiine.” I shifted my cigarette to my left hand and reached out to shake Karen’s. It took her a while to find it, but when she did, she held on with a soft but unyielding grasp.</p>
                <p>“How old are you?” Karen said, swaying towards me with her pelvis. Her breath smelled of expensive liquor.</p>
                <p>“Nineteen. Almost twenty. Nineteen.”</p>
                <p>“Nineteen!” They both exclaimed, sharing a flirtatious glance. “I barely remember when I was nineteen!” my nameless companion purred again.</p>
                <p>“Suzanna, just imagine what we could do to this one,” Karen said, moving her hand to the small of my back. Karen and Suzanna, okay. “Ugh, do you have a cigarette? I’m positively dying for a cigarette. I always start craving one when I drink.”</p>
                <p>“Sure I do,” I said, reaching into my pocket, becoming uncomfortably aware of how crumpled my pack looked after walking around all day. My dad smoked Marlboros so I was pretty sure they were still cool. I wish it had been a new pack. I handed her a cigarette and asked Karen if she needed a light, causing both women to glance at one another again.</p>
                <p>“Now guess how old we are,” Suzanna said reaching for my exposed forearm. “You two can’t be over thirty,” I said with a grin, exuding the brown nosing confidence I’d had since I learned to systematically underestimate a woman’s age in middle school. Both of them practically giggled and advanced their hands along my body.</p>
                <p>“I’m thirty-five,” Suzanna began, “Karen is forty-seven. And you’re cute.”</p>
                <p>“Oh don’t be so honest Suzanna! What do you think a nineteen year old will want to do with someone who’s forty-seven? But you’re right, he is a cute one!” Karen exclaimed, reaching her other hand to Suzanna’s ass, completing our makeshift circle of friends.</p>
                <p>“Hey sugar how ‘bout some of that for me?” a denizen of Grand Central station yelled to Karen.</p>
                <p>“Oh go fuck yourself you homeless pig!” Suzanna interjected before turning to me, “Us two have only fucked twice but it’s not like we’re a show for some pervert on the street! Plus we were both really drunk and only Karen is really drunk tonight.”</p>
                <p>“I am not that drunk!” Karen protested as she stumbled over to the nearest ashtray.</p>
                <p>“Let’s get you into a cab hun,” Suzanna said to Karen, still petting my arm and purring at me again. The three of us strode to the street - I was in the middle – and we hailed a cab. I guided Karen into the cab as she struggled to pull herself in, and before departing I delivered a swift, distinctly out of character kiss to her hand and bid her goodnight, Suzanna purring the entire time.</p>
                <p>“Now that that beautiful drunk is gone I have you all to myself! So tell, tell, tell what is it that you do when you’re nineteen? Do you work, do you play? Tell me, what are you doing out this wonderful evening!” She crooned, whisking me back to the sidewalk, managing to exude an alcohol-ridden grace that my tenure at college had left me entirely unaccustomed to. I, on the other hand tripped, almost imperceptibly, getting back up on the curb. I hoped she hadn’t noticed.</p>
                <p>“I work as a bartender in Battery Park City right now, but I go to school in Boston during the year.” I said, flicking my dying cigarette to the gutter and pulling out another one. As I lit it I realized that for adults, ‘the year’ was just the year, not the school year. Fucking moron.</p>
                <p>“Boston! Where? Tell me everything!” Suzanna said as she shuffled around her purse, clearly looking for something.</p>
                <p>“I go to Harvard, I’m going to be a sophomore.”</p>
                <p>“No way! I don’t believe you!” She pulled out a tube of bright red lipstick and generously applied it to her lips.</p>
                <p>“It’s the truth.” I flicked the ash from my cigarette and crossed my arms. “UNBELIEVABLE! My gay stepbrother did his graduate studies there.” I started to respond but she continued over me, “He’s amaaaaaaazaballs! You really must meet him, really! He knows people.” She shuffled around her purse again until she pulled out her sleek, unscathed smartphone, and started dialing a number. “Helllllloooooooo my darling queer, how the hell have you been?” she jubilantly exclaimed into the phone. She briefly covered the microphone and leaned towards me to say, “It’s okay, I love my gays and they know it!” Jesus. I continued to drag on my cigarette and pulled out my phone to check my texts. It was dead. Well fuck me. “Thorin darling, what are you doing tonight, I’ve met a lovely young man that you must meet!” There was a pause in her conversation, but her purring never relented. “Barrage? Perfect! We’re at Grand Central, we’ll be over in the blink of an eye!” Suzanna kissed the air in front of her twice and hung up the phone. “Let’s go on an adventure cutie!” she said again dragging me to the street. I can’t say I tried to resist her tugging, but my phone felt heavier in my pocket now that I knew it had died. Suzanna stuck her slender arm out to hail a cab and tightened her grasp around my arm with her other. I flexed.</p>
                <p>A taxi pulled up and I opened the door open for her, excited for her to reward me with another purr. I wasn’t let down. I slid in next to her and shut the door. “Yes, hello, take us to 47<span>th </span>and 9<span>th </span>Avenue. Quickly please!” I hated when people order cabbies around, but I never verbalized my objection, nor did a grimace ever cross my face. The cab sped off towards Times Square as Suzanna shifted her legs toward me, not caring at all that her dress had started to ride up. “So what did you think of Karen?” she said touching her knee to mine.</p>
                <p>“I like her. She seems quite fun.” Since when did I start saying ‘quite’? “Even if she’s forty-seven?”</p>
                <p>“Well of course, what difference could that possibly make?”</p>
                <p>“Oooooh I like you cutie. You’re smooth.” She said with another purr. My years spent as an actor in high school plays were paying off.</p>
                <p>“You’re not so bad yourself gorgeous.” Suzanna shifted a little in her seat and moved nearer to me.</p>
                <p>“Karen and I met outside a club two years ago. She was even more drunk than she was tonight and the bouncer was giving her a hard time, so I helped her out. A shimmy here and there can get you far.” She winked. “So anyway, I had a boy wrapped around my finger and Karen took a liking to us, so we all went back to my place and had a positively sensual threesome!” She paused for a bit, clearly proud of herself. “She’s a hot mess, but I love her for it! And we’ve only fucked one other time, so don’t go getting any ideas!” Suzanna moved her hand to my knee. “What do you think of all this cutie?” I had to think a moment about what to say, but I don’t think I was awkward. Hopefully at least.</p>
                <p>“You’re quite a fascinating woman Suzanna, I very much enjoy your stories. I do have one question for you though. Where are we going?”</p>
                <p>“Barrage darling! Have you never been to Barrage?"</p>
                <p>“No, I’m afraid I haven’t, what exactly is Barrage?”</p>
                <p>“It’s a gay bar! A wonderful, wonderful gay bar in Hell’s Kitchen! Nothing too fancy. Nothing too gay either. It’s just right for tonight!” I’d grown up in Hell’s Kitchen so I felt much more comfortable about hopping into a cab with a strange woman now that I knew our destination. Plus it got me closer to the A train for when I would have to go home.</p>
                <p>“Sounds like a great time. Do you go there a lot?” I asked, hoping she wouldn’t catch on to my act consisting of a string of clichés and facades.</p>
                <p>“Only when I’m seeing Thorin, my other gays prefer the gayer bars! Those bars are amaaaazaballs!” I didn’t know what to think of how she talked about “her gays” but before I even had time to let my mind ponder it, she interjected with “How do you like my dress?”</p>
                <p>“It’s fabulously elegant.” I said, and Suzanna’s eyes narrowed as a smile crept over her face.</p>
                <p>“It’s Chanel. You know who bought it for me?” I obviously couldn’t, but I played along.</p>
                <p>“George Clooney?”</p>
                <p>“Don’t be ridiculous cutie! This dress was a gift from the previous owner of the Ritz Carlton! He’s older, but he’s…” she rubbed her fingers together as if they were full of bills. She shimmied with pride.</p>
                <p>“Good for you!” I said, my tone reflecting a wholeheartedness my mind thought was hilarious.</p>
                <p>“Isn’t it though?! He bought me this necklace too. Tiffany’s of course. And this shawl. Gucci.”</p>
                <p>“Well you just have yourself a sugar daddy don’t you?” I said with a chuckle. “Oh we haven’t fucked or anything! He buys me things and I go out with him and he buys me drinks. But I’ve never seen his dick! Not once.” I’d never seen anyone so deeply satisfied with themself, it almost seemed impossible. Suzanna started counting on her fingers. “Seven grand. In two months he’s bought me seven grand’s worth of pretty things!” She clapped a few times, more to herself than to me. I just tried to keep smiling. “Ooh ooh right here is perfect, pull over!”</p>
                <p>We had reached 9<span>th </span>Avenue and 45<span>th </span>Street. Suzanna impatiently paid with her credit card and manually entered a tip, undercutting the 10% default button by a few dollars, and slid out of the cab. “Thank you very much,” I said to the cabbie as I exited.</p>
                <p>Suzanna trotted down the sidewalk in her high heels and I tried to keep pace. Where did she get all this energy? “I need some cigarettes,” she exclaimed as she grabbed my hand and made a sharp turn into a mini mart. There was one person in line ahead of us and Suzanna wasted no time introducing herself. She immediately wrapped an arm around the man’s shoulder and said, “Hey there darling, how’s your night been?” The rather meek looking man shot a glance at me as if he were looking for some solid ground to stand on and all I could do was smile back and shrug, half due to a deep understanding and half due to the comical spiral that the night had become. The young man lifted her arm off his shoulder, paid the cashier, and walked out the door with his head hung. “What’s his problem? A sexy woman puts her arm around him and he leaves! The world we live in!” She directed this to the entire mini mart and settled her gaze on the cashier. “I’d like a pack of Marlboro Lights. And this pack of gum.” She said selecting a fruit flavored pack of Trident.</p>
                <p>“Where are you from?” the cashier inquired of Suzanna in a heavy accent, the glint in his eye making it clear he wanted to take advantage of her outgoing nature.</p>
                <p>“Amsterdam, and yourself you lovely man?” she replied without hesitation.</p>
                <p>“Bangalore. Have you ever been?” he asked after seeing Suzanna’s face light up.</p>
                <p>“Yes of course! I didn’t like it as much as Goa or Mumbai.” The cashier looked slightly hurt and feebly tried to convince her that his home deserved another chance, but Suzanna had already moved on and was on her way out the door.</p>
                <p>“Thank you,” I uttered to the cashier before following Suzanna back to the street. She lit up a cigarette while she strode uptown, quite purposefully jingling her bracelets.</p>
                <p>We rounded the corner of 47<span>th </span>and Suzanna dialed her phone. “Thorin, where the hell are you, we’re coming up right outside!” She hung up the phone without waiting for his response and within ten seconds a handsome young man wearing a green polo shirt and seersucker shorts exited a bar a few steps down the street from us. “THORIN DARLING!” Suzanna exclaimed trotting towards the man.</p>
                <p>“Well helloooo there gorgeous, how are you this beautiful summer night?” he said with a cursory wave of his hand.</p>
                <p>“I am positively glorious my dear. I met someone very strange this evening!” she declared triumphantly, pulling on my arm and lording me at her stepbrother like a trophy. I stuck my hand out and introduced myself.</p>
                <p>“Thorin, it’s a pleasure,” the man said in an audibly disinterested tone. “Does anyone have a smoke?”</p>
                <p>“Sure,” I said offering him a cigarette.</p>
                <p>“Are those reds? I only smoke Lights. Suzanna darling do you have one?” She handed him one from her pack. “So how did you two meet?”</p>
                <p>“Well!” Suzanna couldn’t have been more delighted to recount her tale, “this beautiful young man, he’s only nineteen! He was standing outside Grand Central smoking a cigarette and I just thought he seemed so strange! Different even! And you’ll never guess what he does with his time.”</p>
                <p>“You’re quite right Suzanna darling, you may as well just let it go yourself.”</p>
                <p>“He studies at Harvard! You studied there! How charming!” Suzanna was practically beside herself, and clapped in honor of her introducing the two of us. “Oh is that so?” Thorin inquired of me, his interest finally peaked, but only slightly.</p>
                <p>“Yes, I’m going into my sophomore year in the fall,” I said. “What dorm did you live in last year?” He was testing me.</p>
                <p>“Stoughton,” I said, “it was nice, but quite a shock compared to my prior living arrangement.” I pulled out my last cigarette and lit it.</p>
                <p>“I lived in Pennypacker, and indeed I know the sentiment. Upper East Side?”</p> 
                <p>“Of course. Am I that transparent?” I lied through my teeth and let out a</p>
                <p>chuckle that Thorin harmonized with. I’d gone to school on the Upper East Side but I grew up in Harlem. It’s not like they’d ever find out though right?</p>
                <p>“Are you on any teams there? I was on varsity fencing and polo myself.”</p>
                <p>“I actually initiated a club croquet team this past year. We did quite well.” He was totally gonna buy it.</p>
                <p>“If only they’d had that team there when I was attending classes! My father used to play croquet with me every weekend as a boy.” I almost lost it.</p>
                <p>Thorin took one last long drag on his Marlboro Light and tossed it to the curb before placing his hand on Suzanna’s back, “Come come, let’s go back in, the bartender tonight is quite cute.” My cigarette wasn’t even close to being finished, but I flicked it into the street and followed the duo into Barrage.</p>
                <p>The dimly lit bar smelled overwhelmingly of cologne and promiscuity, every table occupied by at least two people suspending their faces as close to each others’ as possible without touching. At first it seemed like our trio might not find room to sit, but before I even had time to doubt the illustrious step-siblings, Thorin waved to the bartender who gestured to a few open seats and promptly began pouring his drink as we each took a stool at the bar. “What would you like darling?” Suzanna asked, petting my leg. I hadn’t come prepared with something in mind, so I blurted out my fallback drink: Jameson on the rocks. “Don’t tell me darling, tell this handsome man behind the bar,” she said, winking at the bartender who seemed more interested in making eye contact with me than with Suzanna.</p>
                <p>“Jameson on the rocks please.” I said to the man with a smile. Never hurts to flirt with the bartender right? Suzanna ordered a glass of champagne and Thorin’s Stella Artois had just arrived.</p>
                <p>“So Suzanna, how has the week treated you so far?” Thorin inquired, more as a nicety than out of genuine interest.</p>
                <p>“Well let’s see, what’s today again?” Suzanna clicked her tongue against her teeth and crossed her legs.</p>
                <p>“Monday,” I said.</p>
                <p>“Amazaballs, yes thank you gorgeous! Well in that case it’s been lovely thus far! I woke up with a mimosa, had lunch at the Modern with Clio, then met up with Karen for drinks around three, and tonight I found this lovely young man and just couldn’t contain myself!” The bartender brought us our drinks and Suzanna and I clinked our glasses together and each took a sip. Mine was more of a swig.</p>
                <p>“Sounds like quite the week so far dear,” Thorin said pulling out his phone, “you absolutely must see these pictures from my trip upstate this weekend.”</p>
                <p>“Oh you went up to the house!? With whom? Harumph, I want to go up there!” Suzanna pushed her lips out in a pout and crossed her arms under her chest. Thorin’s response was to plop his iPhone in the pronounced cleavage of her blouse. Suzanna unfolded her arms and fished for the phone, giving Thorin a playful slap on the leg when she found it. She brought it to her face and quickly flipped through what must have been at least one hundred pictures.</p>
                <p>Thorin sipped his beer and narrated some of the pictures, having of course memorized each one after countless viewings, “That one was when Eliot and I tried to cross the river in bare feet, but he stubbed his toe, poor thing could barely walk the rest of the day.”</p>
                <p>“So how aaaare things with Eliot?” Suzanna kept her gaze on the screen. “Oh he’s a doll, we had a lovely time this weekend. And you know how I like</p>
                <p>my men short.” He said with a wink at Suzanna. I saw the bartender gaze at Thorin, possibly finding himself uncharacteristically upset by his over-six-foot stature.</p>
                <p>“Mmm darling I like my men short too,” Suzanna said pressing her leg into mine and placing her hand on my thigh. She stood a good five inches above me in her shoes.</p>
                <p>“And <span>that </span>one is from the ‘20’s party my parents throw every year. This year they rented out the Apollo Theatre <span>and </span>Governor’s Island.” I leaned in close to Suzanna and peered at the pictures with her. Thorin was wearing a white suit and a felt hat and was sitting with a few other people at a table in a deeply green lawn. There were too many pictures of their meal and drinks, regardless of how <span>exquisite </span>they were. I swigged at my Jameson again.</p>
                <p>“I like the white suit Thorin. Very dapper.” I was getting some kind of thrill out of testing my acting abilities. Seemed like college hadn’t dulled them too much.</p>
                <p>“Why thank you!” He seemed genuinely pleased by the compliment. “I was Gatsby, of course.” Of course.</p>
                <p>Suzanna finished going through Thorin’s pictures and ordered another round of drinks. “So speaking of boys,” Thorin began, “you’ve found quite a cute one here. Does he know all about you and your ways Suzanna, or is he still riding up the roller coaster?”</p>
                <p>“Oh hush Thorin! Don’t listen to him cutie, I have no idea what he’s talking about!” Suzanna said laughing. A Ke$ha music video came on the televisions in the bar and Suzanna began giggling and clapping. “Come on I love this song!”</p>
                <p>Suzanna gulped down more of her drink, I followed suit, and she grabbed my hand and dragged me out into the middle of the bar. Thorin returned to his phone. I could feel people glancing at us – we were the only two planning on dancing in the</p>
                <p>place. Suzanna began swaying and shimmying a little. I had never been a very good dancer so I wasn’t sure how I was going to play this off. I grabbed Suzanna’s hands and did my best to move in any way that wasn’t overtly unattractive. At least I could keep time. “You know you aren’t half bad at this,” Suzanna said in my ear, “but try this!” she guided my hands to her hips and pulled me in closer to her. “Like this.” She whispered in my ear. We started getting in a groove together, but just when it seemed like we were really clicking, the song ended. “Come, come, we need another drink! At least another!”</p>
                <p>Suzanna and I rejoined Thorin, who had since begun flirting more with the bartender just for fun, but Suzanna had no problem interrupting them. “Another round of the same if you don’t mind!” He seemed a little dismayed to have been called back to work but he obliged.</p>
                <p>“Thanks,” Thorin said, “he was getting a little too into me.”</p> 
                <p>“What did you think of our dancing Thorin dear?”</p>
                <p>“Huh? Oh, it was… quite elegant.” Thorin hadn’t looked up from his phone other than to toy with the bartender.</p>
                <p>“Wasn’t it though? This young man has some moves after all!” she said moving her hand up my thigh.</p>
                <p>“Yes it seems like he can keep up with even you Suzanna, what if you’ve finally met your match?”</p>
                <p>“Oh don’t be silly Thorin, the night is still young!” Our drinks arrived and Suzanna began consuming hers immediately. I sipped at mine, being sure to keep up my guard at least a little bit. The bartender came over to us and told us that the bar</p>
                <p>would be closing in fifteen minutes, and I became suddenly aware of how empty it had gotten.</p>
                <p>“First one to finish gets to come home with me tonight!” Suzanna declared! Thorin wasn’t interested, and I wasn’t sure if I would come off as too eager if I tried for the prize. Before I had time to decide, Suzanna had already finished her drink, “Looks like I’m taking myself home tonight! Oh well, looks like I’ll just have to find some way to keep myself entertained!”</p>
                <p>“Come on, let’s get outta here, it’s dead and it’s only 1 a.m.” Suzanna picked up her purse and rummaged around, pulling out a slip of paper. “Ah of course, I almost forgot! I need to pick up my sweater from the Ritz!” She exclaimed hustling out the door. So as it seemed, the night would move to the Ritz Carlton. “Come, come it’s just across the street and around the corner!” Thorin and I followed her around a corner when I saw a blue awning that proudly displayed “Ritz” in cheesy cursive letters, under which a throng of people milled about smoking cigarettes and comparing their drag. “We’re here!”</p>
                <p>Suzanna hustled down the street, having perfectly mastered the art of</p>
                <p>running in four-inch heels. I hanged back with Thorin trying to remain subtle about watching Suzanna. “She sure is a wild one isn’t she?” Thorin mused tucking his hands into his pockets.</p>
                <p>“Tonight has certainly been unexpected.”</p>
                <p>He let out a low chuckle and elbowed me slightly. “She’s really taken a shine to you, kid.” By the time he finished his sentence, we’d caught up to Suzanna who was now schmoozing with the bouncer, a burly man with a double-chin-goatee.</p>
                <p>“Are you absolutely, positively sure you haven’t run across a teeny little pink sweater this past weekend? Couldn’t you look again, just for me?”</p>
                <p>“I come across thirteen teeny weeny little pink sweaters every weekend lady, you can go on in and talk to the bartender about the lost and found box.” He replied, crossing his arms.</p>
                <p>“Fine then!” Suzanna said with a harrumph, “let’s go in boys.” She pulled on Thorin’s and my sleeves.</p>
                <p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa, I’m gonna need to see some ID from the kid.”</p>
                <p>“You’re kidding me right?” Suzanna seductively stepped closer to the man</p>
                <p>and placed her hand on his forearm. “He’s old enough, can’t you plainly see that? Come on…” She rubbed her hand along his arm.</p>
                <p>“ID or he ain’t getting in. That’s that.”</p>
                <p>I had lost my fake ID two weeks prior at Terminal 5 when my friend and I drunkenly tried to go to a concert and my hubris did me in. I just shrugged at Suzanna and took a place leaning on the decorative fence the bar had put up as she and Thorin continued into the bar. “We’ll only be a minute darling!” Suzanna shouted back. Thorin turned his head and gave me a wink.</p>
                <p>“Didn’t mean to cause you any trouble, man.” I said to the bouncer.</p>
                <p>“Don’t worry about it, thanks for not trying to bullshit me. The schtick gets old ya know? Your ‘friend’ is quite the handful…” He uncrossed his arms and loosened his stance.</p>
                <p>“Yeah she’s somethin’.”</p>
                <p>“How’d you end up meeting her? She must be what, fifteen years older than</p>
                <p>you?”</p>
                <p>“She picked me up outside Grand Central,” I curtly replied, as if that sentence could possibly sum up the bizarre evening that was still unfolding.</p>
                <p>“Damn kid. You must have some kinda game.”</p>
                <p>Right at that moment, 2 men in tight shirts and a woman with massive curly hair trotted out of the bar amidst loud chit chat.</p>
                <p>“The DJ tonight is absolute crap Joe. You’ll go rough him up a bit for us big boy, won’t you?” A stout well groomed man said to the bouncer.</p>
                <p>“Why don’t you do it Verne, too scared to chip another nail?” Joe retorted. “Oh hush up you crabby big ol’ bear. What’s gotcha down tonight?” Verne</p>
                <p>inquired?</p>
                <p>“Yeah Joe whatsa matter hun?” One of the women asked. Her voice was quite deep. “Wanna cigarette?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, thanks James.” Ohhhhh. Got it. James placed a cigarette in his mouth and lit it, then passed it to Joe, leaving a ring of red lipstick on the butt. Joe began dragging on the cigarette.</p>
                <p>“And who’s your handsome young friend mister?” the third man asked.</p>
                <p>“Oh I didn’t even catch your name kiddo. I’m Joe,” he said extending his hand. I introduced myself and shook his hand. “These are the guys. Verne’s the short one, James is the one with the hair, and Christopher over here, well, he’s the sexy one.”</p>
                <p>“You watch yourself Joseph. Hi Kiddo, I’m the one with the hair.” James shook my hand. He had beautiful nail polish.</p>
                <p>“I’m Verne, nice to meet another person under six feet. You’d be surprised how hard that is around here, Kiddo.”</p>
                <p>“And last but certainly not least, if you couldn’t already guess that I’m the sexy one, I’m Christopher!” He said dragging out the I. He reached for my hand and kissed it. “Pleasure to meet you Kiddo.”</p>
                <p>“You smoke Kiddo?” Verne asked handing a cigarette towards me. “Sure, thanks Verne.”</p>
                <p>“So why are you just standing around out here with boring old Joe, come join us inside for the party!”</p>
                <p>“He was just telling me about how a kid like this punk ended up with that leggy blonde that just stormed in.”</p>
                <p>“SHE was your date?” Christopher inquired incredulously. “Bummer.” He winked.</p>
                <p>“She must’ve been at least 35. And that dress must’ve cost a whole lot more than you do Kiddo. I should know, I try one on just like it every third Tuesday of the month as a pick me up,” James said with a smile.</p>
                <p>“Tell the boys how you ended up with her Kiddo,” Joe requested of me. “She picked me up outside Grand Central,” I replied in short again.</p>
                <p>“Well you do have a cute butt.” Christopher said, craning his neck to get a better view.</p>
                <p>“Thanks,” I said with a smile, “you too baby.” Everybody cracked up.</p>
                <p>“Ohhh so you think you can run with the best of us huh, Kiddo? Well come on in and let’s see what you’ve got,” James said, grabbing my wrist and starting to pull me towards the door.</p>
                <p>“Whoa there Jamie, Kiddo ain’t allowed in. No ID,” Joe interrupted the giddy</p>
                <p>trio.</p>
                <p>“How old are you Kiddo? I just thought you looked young for your age.” Verne elbowed Joe in the rib.</p>
                <p>“I’m nineteen.”</p>
                <p>“See he’s practically older than you ya big ol’ bastard!” Verne raised his arms into the air before landing them on Joe’s shoulders and shaking. Joe furrowed his graying brow and stood still, arms crossed for what seemed like a whole minute.</p>
                <p>“You’ll keep an eye on the kid right boys?” Joe said huskily. They all nodded vigorously, “and you’ll keep him outta trouble right boys?” They continued to nod vigorously. I was impressed that James’ hair didn’t budge a centimeter. “Alright then, but hurry on in.”</p>
                <p>“Oh Joe, you’re such a sweetheart.” Christopher kissed him on the cheek. I caught Joe blushing the slightest bit.</p>
                <p>The three men rushed me through the door, not even giving me time to thank Joe. The bar reeked of perfume and strong drinks and I kept getting hit in the side with handbags, feather boas, and lots of sequins. “Come on Kiddo, let’s get some drinks!” James pulled me toward the backlit bar. We hustled up to the bartender James gave him the order, “two Manhattans hot stuff! Hope you like Manhattans Kiddo.”</p>
                <p>“Sure I’m up for it.”</p>
                <p>“So where’s the lady of the night, hmm?” James nudged his hip into mine.</p>
                <p>“Not sure, she ran in here with her stepbrother to find a sweater.”</p>
                <p>“Wellllll we’d better get searching Kiddo!” James excitedly spun around to face the crowd on the dance floor and hoisted his rear onto the bar. He gazed across the sea of meticulously styled hair and searched for Suzanna.</p>
                <p>I leaned against the bar and turned to look up the bar to the bartender who was almost finished with our drinks. I was pretty eager to see James after a drink or two. I turned my head to the other end of the bar when I saw Suzanna giggling at something, but I couldn’t see what through all the people. I tapped James on the waist and gave a nod down the bar. He looked towards Suzanna while the bartender handed me the two Manhattans. I winked at him for kicks. He smiled back.</p>
                <p>James turned to me and I handed him his drink and took a sip of mine. I didn’t like it as much as the Jameson, but hey, who can complain about free drinks from a sexy drag queen. James didn’t drink his but instead put his hand on my shoulder and said, “Oh honey, I’m sorry,” casting a look back at Suzanna.</p>
                <p>“Why?” I said as I turned my head down the bar. But then I understood. A well-dressed man with a big dark beard was leaning on the bar next to her as she petted his arm. She wrapped her hand around the back of his neck and pulled his face down to hers and began shamelessly making out. James stared at me with his big blue eyes and scrunched his tweezed brow in concern.</p>
                <p>“Honey… oh honey. She’s too old for you anyway. Way past her prime!” I took another large sip from my drink and stared down at the bar. Then I took another</p>
                <p>swig. “Let me join you baby,” James got off the bar and stood next to me and gulped down his drink, promptly ordering another round. “You know, if you want we can go make her jealous Kiddo.” James winked at me and put his arm around my waist. “Why don’t I show you how us real men dance, and oh, maybe we just <span>happen </span>to bump into them. Whadya say cutie?” James did look hot. Hot enough to make Suzanna pissed.</p>
                <p>“Show me what you’ve got hot stuff!” I said to him and we marched out onto the dance floor just as a new song came on. James did a spin and pulled me by my hands close to his body. He wrapped his arms around my shoulders and clasped his hands behind my neck. I put my hands on his waist and we started grooving with the crowd. As the music picked up, James began to move more seductively and pressed into me harder. We moved over towards the bar where Suzanna was sitting before, but by the time we came near it seemed that she had already left with Beardy McFuckface.</p>
                <p>“James, I think she’s already gone.”</p>
                <p>“Hmm, so she is,” he said, pulling me back out to the dance floor. He turned his head and spoke into my ear, “so you’re 19 hmm?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, just finished up my first year at Harvard. How old are you if I may be so forward?”</p>
                <p>“Ooh a smarty,” he said, “I’m 23, just got out of architecture school at Cooper Union.”</p>
                <p>“And you’re calling me a smarty!” I knew Cooper Union was a great school because I always wanted to be an architect but never had the artistic abilities.</p>
                <p>“Oh yeah, college was a grand time as I’m sure a handsome man like yourself must know.” He pressed his chest to mine and wrapped his arms tighter around my neck.</p>
                <p>“It’s been fun for sure! Can’t really compare it to the gorgeous Ritz you have here though.”</p>
                <p>“Oh well certainly not! We have quite our own brand of fun around here,” he said pulling away a bit so he could wink at me. He stared at me for a moment and then pressed his lips to mine. They were probably the softest lips I’d ever kissed. James pulled his face away from mine, and paused for a moment. I didn’t know what to say. “I’m sorry Kiddo, didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.” He seemed slightly dejected. “I just thought we were getting along.” I still didn’t know what to say so I just sort of stood there looking at him. I’d never kissed a man before. He raised his hand to my face and caressed it. I pressed my hands a little harder into his waist, almost accidentally. His expression of dejection changed and he leaned in again, this time opening his mouth and putting his tongue into mine. He pulled away again and smiled at me, “want to go outside for a smoke Kiddo?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, that sounds great,” I said with a small smile back. We made our way off the dance floor, James leading my by the hand and we stepped out the door. Joe was no longer there and instead the door to the club slammed shut behind us. I suppose it was later than I’d thought. James lit a cigarette in his mouth and handed it to me, then lit one for himself.</p>
                <p>“I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable cutie. There’s just something about you. I couldn’t resist!”</p>
                <p>“I mean, I can’t say I wasn’t surprised. I’d never kissed a man before.” James dragged on the cigarette and turned his eyes to the pavement. “I didn’t say I didn’t like it James. I was just surprised is all.”</p>
                <p>James smiled at me. “You really did run with the best of us tonight Kiddo, I’m impressed.” He took out a little slip of paper and grabbed a pen that happened to be lying in the ashtray next to the door. “Here,” he said handing me the paper, “gimme a call sometime if you need something a little different than a college party.”</p>
                <p>I dragged on my cigarette one last time and extinguished it in the ashtray. “Thanks, I might just have to take you up on that sometime,” I said with a smile.</p>
                <p>“Well, I suppose I should be getting back, I have work tomorrow. I bet you wouldn’t even recognize me if you saw me tomorrow.” He put his cigarette in the ashtray and gave me a kiss on the cheek. “It was a pleasure meeting you Kiddo,” he said before turning and walking down the street in his electric blue heels.</p>
                <p>I stood outside the club trying to recount what had happened that night. I pulled out my phone to check the time and realized that yes, it was still out of batteries. I don’t know what I expected. Judging by the street traffic it must have been sometime after two, probably closer to after three. Fuck. My dad would kill me, I’d planned on being home five hours ago.</p>
                <p>I jogged down the street until I reached Broadway and I hailed the first cab I saw, no time to deal with the A after express hours. I slid into the backseat and directed the cabbie uptown. “130<span>th </span>and St. Nick, please.”</p>
                <p>“Sure thing kid, easy. You look like you just had some kinda night, kid. Any good stories for a bored as fuck cabbie?”</p>  
            </div>
            <div class="story piece">
                <p class="title">Snowfall</p>
                <p class="date">Nov 2013</p>               
                <p>“So when do you find out from Yale?” I asked Mark as he pulled out his pack of Marlboros.</p>
                <p>“Day after tomorrow.” He flicked his lighter once or twice. “Nervous?”</p>
                <p>“Fuck off,” he said with chuckle. He pulled out a joint from the pack of cigarettes and brought it to his mouth. The copper streetlamps lent a serene tint to the delicately falling snowflakes and the fresh white blanket on the ground; Central Park always felt so isolated in December. “When’s Princeton get back to you?”</p>
                <p>“Tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>“Damn.” He brought the lighter up to the tip of the twisted paper and took a deep</p>
                <p>drag.</p>
                <p>Mark passed me the joint. “Hey, thanks for doing this tonight, I needed something to calm my nerves,” I said.</p>
                <p>“Hey my pleasure. Let’s go hang on that bench for a while, don’t wanna end up on Central Park West before we finish,” he said gesturing towards a secluded patch of asphalt, surrounded by a couple of benches.</p>
                <p>“Good call,” I said as we started making our way up the slight incline, periodically passing the joint back and forth. “I dunno what I’ll do if I don’t get in,” I said, taking a seat on the bench, “I’ve cried myself to sleep over work too many times to have it all end with a rejection. This is my whole future on the line.”</p>
                <p>“Sometimes I wonder if the stress has all been worth it.”</p>
                <p>“I guess we’ll both see soon huh?” I nuzzled my chin into my scarf and slid my hands into my pockets. It must have been less than ten degrees that night, but it felt comfortable.</p>
                <p>“I can’t believe this is our last year here,” I said, staring up into the orange New York City sky.</p>
                <p>“Remember that time in 4th grade,” Mark began, already starting to chuckle, “when you ripped your pants right before you had to present your project on Christopher Columbus?” He laughed as he took another hit.</p>
                <p>“I’m gonna miss this place,” I said.</p>
                <p>“I’m gonna miss you man! I really hope tomorrow goes well for you.” He said as he exhaled. The smoke looked especially thick as it mixed with his freezing breath.</p>
                <p>“And hey, if we both get in, we’re only gonna be a few hours apart!” I said taking a final drag on the roach. Mark pulled out another joint and lit it. We sat in silence, passing it, looking at the expansive sky.</p>
                <p>The subtle crunching of snow broke the silence and our ears perked up. We remained seated; it was probably just a squirrel. A flash of fluorescent red and blue lights penetrated the orange glow from the road we were sitting just off of. Mark’s eyes opened wide, as he quickly shoved the joint into his mouth and began chewing. He said nothing but stared at me and stood up. I knew exactly what he was saying: just calmly walk away, everything is fine. We began to walk through the mulch, over the husks of hibernating bushes when a burly voice called out, “You two!” We kept walking, our heads down; we knew it was over.</p>
                <p>“You two! Stop!” We had no choice. The car had pulled around in front of us and blocked our path. Two NYPD officers stepped out of the car, the floodlights at their backs illuminating the snow, which was starting to fall faster. “Take your hands out of your pockets!” We both obliged and held our opened hands at chest level. This couldn’t be happening.</p>
                <p>The officer who had been yelling commands strode over to Mark and instructed him to place his hands behind his back. The snow whirred around me and it felt like the entire world was spinning. The other officer approached me and instructed me to take out my wallet and hand it to him. “Any blades or needles in here that I should know about?” he asked me.</p>
                <p>“No sir,” I replied, remembering my older brother’s disposition when he demonstrated what boot camp was like. Mark didn’t say a word as handcuffs were placed on his wrists and his head was pushed to the hood of the police car. It made a haunting thud.</p>
                <p>“Do you have any drugs on you?” the officer said as he inspected my ID.</p>
                <p>“No sir,” I replied truthfully. I turned my eyes to Mark, who was staring directly at me. The wind started to blow directly across my face and whisked ice into my cheeks. Mark had another joint in his pack of cigarettes.</p>
                <p>The officers searched me while Mark and I kept our gazes fixed on one another, and when the officers were content that I was free of illicit substances the officer said, “Well asshole, it’s your lucky day.” The snow was coming down harder now and I watched it pile up in Mark’s hair and get caught in his eyelashes. I tucked my wallet back into my pocket, and lingered there, staring at Mark. “Well? Get the fuck outta here kid!” The wind whipped snow into my face and it made me squint my eyes, but I remained there. “No sir.”</p>
                <p>“No? You can’t stay here kid. This is your last chance, now go!” the officer said taking a step towards me and placing his hand on his set of cuffs.</p>
                <p>“I’m staying sir.”</p>
                <p>The officer began approaching me when Mark’s bloodshot red eyes filled with fury and he yelled, “Go you fucking idiot, get the fuck out of here!” I wanted to stay, to say I’m sorry, it will be okay, we’ll figure something out, but all I could do was take one last look and turn away. I took ten steps before I started sprinting towards Central Park West, headfirst into the blinding snow.</p>
                <p>The next day, the walls in which I spent the last thirteen years felt cold and unfamiliar. In class I could feel my skin crawling, my palms sweating. The teacher’s glances looked blameful and the students looked like strangers. I was the one who asked him to bring the weed; it was my fault. How could Mark ever forgive me for what happened when his entire future would be ruined?</p>
                <p>Minutes and then hours passed as I waited for a text, a call, an email, anything from Mark that would make my heart stop pounding and my head stop spinning. The entire day it seemed like I was going to lose my balance at any instant. When I got the email from Princeton telling me I was accepted, I barely even cared. There was nothing I could do but keep waiting.</p>
                <p>After school I sat on my couch and looked out the window. The snow had subsided since the night before and all that was left was the blackened slush. At long last my phone vibrated. I picked up before even checking the caller ID. “Mark?”</p>
                <p>“Hey man did you get in?” he said with excitement. “What? That’s it?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, so did they let you in?!”</p> 
                <p>“Umm, yeah Mark, I was accepted.”</p>
                <p>“Holy shit that’s awesome! Congratulations!”</p>
                <p>“Thanks, but what the hell happened last night Mark?”</p> 
                <p>“Nothing, man, it’s fine.”</p>
                <p>“Mark you were arrested because of me!”</p>
                <p>“Yeah I was arrested. But that’s all,” he said with finality. “Wanna play Xbox?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah… sure… come on over. But… how aren’t you mad at me?”</p>
                <p>“Oh shut up. Let’s play Halo.”</p>
                <p>“So…you nervous about finding out tomorrow?”</p>
                <p>“Fuck off,” he said with a laugh. “I’ll be over in fifteen.”</p>
                <p>I hung up the phone and walked over to the window. The orange streetlights turned on and illuminated the street fourteen stories below. The snow had started falling again, gently shimmering in the copper light.</p>

                <p class="title">Bartholomew</p>
                <p class="date">Oct 2013</p>
                <p>Bartholomew was startled awake by a particularly abrupt shift in the tracks. He jerked slightly, regained his composure, and wiped the drool from the corner of his lips. He groggily retrieved his mug of coffee and leaned his head against the glass of the cabin window. He thoroughly enjoyed watching the countryside fly by - it served as a pleasant distraction from his impending reunion with his parents. The warmth of the coffee felt good on his freezing hands, which were quickly turning a deep cobalt. He took a sip, only to immediately spit it out against the window when his mouth was overcome with the taste of blood. In the deep maroon fountain of liquid emanating from Bartholomew’s mouth, was a small pearl of bone that audibly clinked against the window and fell onto the leathery seat next to him. Bartholomew moved his right arm in the hope of further inspecting the item, but he found himself to be bound by a pair of steely handcuffs. He tongued around the new hole in his mouth and found that the gentle kiss of his tongue forced the remaining teeth from his mouth and onto the seat. This was unusual, since Bartholomew had always taken dental hygiene very seriously after his mother had taught him the importance of an authentic looking smile - one that could fool anyone. He panicked and continued to lick his gums in vain, finally making an attempt to call for help, only to find that his tongue had severed at the back of his throat rendering him mute. He spit the throbbing flesh from his mouth in helpless disgust.</p>
                <p>In an attempt to distract himself, Bartholomew pawed around for his phone, finding it in his right front pocket, but to his dismay, he also found that a good deal of moisture had accumulated on his pants in his slumber. Taking advantage of his private cabin, he quickly unzipped his trousers, fearing that his nervous adolescent nocturnal emissions had come back to haunt him. As he peeled the denim from his loins, his hands were met with the unmistakable viscosity of fresh semen. “Well that’s an unpleasant surprise,” Bartholomew thought to himself as he rose from his seat, dropped his trousers and briefs to the ground, and went to fetch a fresh outfit from his travel bag. He stepped one foot then the other through the legs of his clean briefs and only then noticed that he was conspicuously missing his genitalia. All the bells and whistles were absent, and in their place was a smooth patch of hairless skin. Bartholomew’s mind reeled and he felt his stomach drop in its familiar way. Knowing that there was no way for him to solve his problem and no way to call for help after losing his tongue, he settled upon dressing himself with shaky hands in his new green trousers and navy woolen sweater. He sat back down and soothed his worried mind into submission and casually forced his troubles from his thoughts, utilizing his years of expertise.</p>
                <p>Bartholomew resigned himself to quiet contemplation, his bound hands making his seating options scarce and uncomfortable. Bartholomew peered out the window, lamenting that the fine fall day was being wasted on the interior of a train cabin. He could practically feel the waning warmth of the October sun. On second thought, he could literally feel the heat. Bartholomew flew from his seat as a satanic flame sprouted from his rear, sending him speeding through the cabin door and into the dining car, his eyes desperately searching for the relief of a cup of water. Without the help of his bound arms to stabilize his motion, not to mention the throbbing pain in his rear, Bartholomew found himself spiraling to the ground, his head whipping around and catching the eyes of the other passengers; lifeless, unresponsive, reflective like glass.</p>
                <p>Bartholomew’s face was plastered to the floor, his gaze fixed upon a young father and his son, the only two passengers who seemed to be real. They sat at a table munching on french fries as the father helped his son with the crossword in his activity booklet. Bartholomew watched the boy fill in a word, his father tussling his hair with a prideful smile. With his dying breaths Bartholomew desperately tried to crawl to the father and son, pushing harder than he ever had to reach something. As the pain bore further into his body and mind the pair seemed further and further away. Bartholomew collapsed, the life and hope thrust out of his body as the demonic flame consumed him from the inside out.</p>
                <p>Bartholomew’s eyelids split open, his hands and neck covered in a cold sweat. He reached his hand down his trousers and was pleased to find his manhood firmly attached to his pelvis. It must have all been a horrible dream. He tongued around his mouth, satisfied to find everything in order. At least he could still fake a smile. He’d need to that weekend, after all, it was his first time visiting his mother at home since his father’s release.</p>

                <p class="title">Matt & Matild</p>
                <p class="date">Sept 2013</p>
                <p>Matthew, as he preferred to be called after abandoning his college nickname in favor of a more “professional” alternative, lethargically pressed his slender index finger to the silvery power key. The boot up tone of the computer echoed in the cavernous Tribeca apartment, reverberating on the expensive items within. Matthew slowly straightened his back, winced his eyes at the bright loading screen, and let his hand come to rest on the steely mouse. It was time to begin work for the night. He opened Facebook and hoped to see some notification or message that would demand his attention, but had no such luck and reluctantly opened his design software. He toyed with the Apple mouse, aimlessly scrolling through old blueprints for any shred of example of advice. After a few moments of everything but inspiration, he put his hands back in his dark-washed jeans and slid down in his chair, letting his shaggy yet styled hair flow down its leather back. Tea would help him think.</p>
                <p>As he placed the kettle on the flame, the familiar sound of the industrial water pipes heating up filled the air and the shower sputtered to a start. Music began to flow out of the bathroom, accompanied by a woman’s voice, amplified by the tiled walls and high ceilings. Matthew was glad that he decided to make tea at the exact moment Matilda had begun singing, since he wouldn’t be able to focus on work anyway. He retrieved the stained mesh tea ball from the frosted glass cupboard and carefully packed it with his favorite herbal blend. Just as he removed the top of the stone kettle and turned on the stainless steel faucet, he heard the shower stop. Matthew returned to his desk and resumed scrolling through his most recent project. His father had demanded that he make the engine design more powerful, but Matthew couldn’t convince himself that he could solve the problem, no matter how much his father pressed him. The peeling wooden door let out a gentle and calming squeak as a young, lithe silhouette stepped out in a luxurious towel.</p>
                <p class="break">* * *</p>
                <p>Matt’s youthful eyes lit up as he caught the glint of the tuning pegs peering out from behind the patchwork stage left curtain. He had been waiting at the foot of the small, weathered stage for hours, determined to be as close to DeYarmond Edison as possible. He felt the crowd milling around him, but he remained rigid and watchful, save for one swift movement as he pulled off the hood of his brand new, purple NYU sweatshirt for a better view. The old, orange tinted lights flickered and went out and Matt broke into a wide grin. The small, underground room was silent except for the footsteps of the band members approaching their instruments; Matt hung on every creak of the stage. One rose tinted light flicked onto the center of the stage. He was so close that he could bask in the soft glowing warmth.</p>
                <p>The anticipation in Matt’s stomach grew almost unbearable until the acoustic guitar let out a lengthy yawn and Justin Vernon broke into his inspiring falsetto croon. Matt couldn’t restrain himself from reaching out and pressing his hands to the worn wooden stage upon which his idols stood. He could feel the vibrations of the stage as he closed his eyes and fell into a blanket of sound, only to be jarred awake by the brutish push of another concertgoer drunkenly trying to pry his way to the front. A young woman next to him let out a small shriek, just loud enough for Matt to hear as the man shoved her into the foot of the stage.</p>
                <p>Matt wasn’t normally a man of conflict or confrontation, but his meditation had been interrupted. He turned to the tall, bulky man behind him and said, “Watch it asshole, some of us are actually trying to appreciate the music,” as he gave the man a decisive shove back. The brute turned around and stumbled back to the bar muttering something about creative faggots and needing another beer. “You okay? I hate guys like that. I can’t stand how…”</p>
                <p>“They don’t even care about the music! All they want is to be at the front so they can feel important,” the young woman interjected, completing Matt’s thought before he could himself. “I’m Matilda, and thanks, I’m fine. Ooh this is my favorite song!” Matilda exclaimed softly so as not to disturb the music.</p>
                <p>“Me too,” Matt said with a smile. Matilda warmly reciprocated.</p>
                <p class="break">* * *</p>
                <p>The light padding of Matilda’s feet across the floor accompanied the music coming from the Bose speakers that she was carrying from the bathroom, each step in tempo of course. She rested the speakers on the mahogany dresser and slid open the drawers, gracefully releasing her grasp of the towel, allowing it to crumple to the floor. Matthew shifted his eyes to the right to try to catch a brief glimpse, his stomach still fluttering while he did so, even after nine years of being with her.</p>
                <p>Matilda pulled out the memory laden, worn out NYU sweatshirt from Matthew’s drawer and strode over to the tea. She knew that Matthew liked his tea slightly under brewed and was able to effortlessly predict its completion without the assistance of the shrill teapot squeal. She retrieved two porcelain cups from the cabinet and poured the tea into each, taking caution to prevent any of the loose leaves from falling in. Matilda carried the tray over to Matthew’s desk and handed him his cup. “How’s the work coming Matt?” she whispered in his ear.</p>
                <p>“You know the answer to that Matilda, and please, it’s Matthew now.”</p>
                <p>“Sorry, sometimes I forget…”</p>
                <p class="break">* * *</p>
                <p>Matilda lay across Matt’s twin XL bed propped up on her elbows, playfully kicking her feet to the beat of the Volcano Choir song emanating from Matt’s record player. Matt sat at his desk, thoughtfully fingering the strings of his guitar. It was already three in the morning and the entire upperclassman dorm seemed dark and quiet, except for the few strings of lights Matt had draped across his desk and his gentle fingerpicking. “I like your decorations,” she said, her focus darting between the miscellaneous records and concert tees hung along the walls. She spun a paintbrush in her fingers and continued, “especially the hubcap you found and the guitar neck you hung up.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, too bad I couldn’t figure out how to fix Amanda after she snapped in half,” he said with a smile. Matilda chuckled and the song ended. There was an open physics textbook and miscellaneous problem sets strewn across an open calculus textbook on his desk, all marked with scribbled staff lines and clefs.</p>
                <p>“So when are you gonna play that song you wrote for me?” Matilda asked. Matt stopped playing and thought for a moment. Her big green eyes stared back at his, her soft lips gracefully curling up as he playfully furrowed his brow.</p>
                <p>“Okay,” he said, “but you have to show me that painting you’ve been working so hard on.”</p>
                <p>“Deal!”</p>
                <p>He cleared his throat and stretched his veteran fingers, which were shaking, a phenomenon completely foreign to him. He fumbled with his all too familiar capo before finally placing it just close enough to the fret to satisfy the momentous situation. Matilda’s eyes never strayed from Matt and Matt’s eyes never strayed from his frets.</p>
                <p>“Sometimes I can’t figure out why you’re an engineer.”</p>
                <p>“I told you Matild, my dad’s not giving me a choice.” Matt stopped his post-song improvisation.</p>
                <p>“I wish you could hear what you just played through my ears. You’d realize that you should be a musician,” she said, sitting up on his bed, her paintbrush no longer spinning in her fingers.</p>
                <p>“Matild, I’ve told you how my dad is. If he saw the way I decorate my room, he’d call it trash. The music I listen to? He’d be ashamed. He’s paying for my education; I don’t have a choice! And besides, he’s right when he says I’m going to need money… we’re going to need money.” Matt quickly removed the record from its player and pushed it into its sleeve, forgoing his routine meticulous inspection of its quality.</p>
                <p>“What about what makes you happy, Matt?”</p>
                <p class="break">* * *</p>
                <p>“Can you please get out of that sweatshirt? And while you’re over there, can you turn the music off so I can focus?”</p>
                <p>“But you know how comfortable this one is Matthew… and this used to be our favorite song. Remember?”</p>
                <p>“Why don’t you wear something from your own drawer, that I bought for you? You look like the bums in Washington Square Park. We’re better than that,” Matthew turned back to his computer screen.</p>
                <p>“You used to play guitar with those <span>bums </span>after classes… I used to paint them.”</p>
                <p>Matilda turned her back to Matthew and returned to the dresser, pulling the purple sweatshirt over her head, not bothering to fold it before returning it to Matthew’s drawer. She slammed the drawer shut, causing Matthew to whip his head around. Matilda stood ten feet away from his computer, her hands on her hips, facing the dresser. He ran his eyes up and down the peaks and valleys of her pale back, which began heaving up and down as she audibly sobbed.</p>
                <p class="break">* * *</p>
                <p>Matt shuffled down the cobbled Tribeca street and entered his new apartment building, his father’s stern voice still ringing in his ears. He climbed up the three flights of concrete stairs to the loft, each step feeling more difficult to conquer than the last. After flipping through every single key on his ring, Matt finally managed to push open the heavy metal door and enter the cavernous, box-filled apartment. “Matilda, I’m home.” Matt said, expecting his voice to sound louder than it did. Music was playing in the living room, and Matilda was painting in the corner where the only unpacked box served as an end table for her paints and brushes, its contents carefully arranged beside the easel: a hubcap, guitar neck, and stack of hand-worn vinyl.</p>
                <p>Matilda didn’t hear the meek announcement of his arrival, and continued dragging and dotting her brush to the beat of the all too familiar song. “Matilda, I’m home,” Matt whispered in her ear, finally alerting her of his presence. She swung around and wrapped her arms around his neck. “Matilda, the suit! You’re covered in paint!”</p>
                <p>“Look Matt, your song inspired me!” she said showing off her canvas. “You’ve been listening to that for years,” he said with a little smile.</p>
                <p>“It still inspires me like it did the first time you played it for me in college.”</p>
                <p>Matt stopped inspecting his jacket for paint marks and stared at Matilda’s constructed shrine. “I like your latest piece,” he said, gesturing slightly towards the keepsakes.</p>
                <p>“Thanks,” she said, her soft lips turning up at the corners. “How was your first day?”</p>
                <p>“Bearable. Dad decided to give me the company tour himself. That was fun,” he said sarcastically. He moved he eyes around the bare walls of the loft. “I’m sorry Matt. Want to play a bit while I paint to relax?”</p>
                <p>“I’m sorry, I can’t, I already have work to do.” Matilda looked at him and wanted to plead, but kept herself silent for his sake. “Oh and would you mind putting on headphones or something? I can’t let myself get distracted.”</p>
                <p>“Okay Matt…”</p>
                <p>“I forgot to mention, Dad said Matthew sounds more professional. Would you mind helping me get used to it?”</p>
                <p>Matilda took her iPod out of its dock and plugged in her headphones, never turning her eyes away from Matthew’s, which had already become distracted by the light of his iPhone. “Sure,” was all she could manage to say.</p>
                <p class="break">* * *</p>
                <p>Matilda opened her drawer and put on her jeans and low cut t-shirt and slipped on her favorite worn out clogs. “Matilda what are you doing? It’s two in the morning.”</p>
                <p>“I need to go clear my head. I’m gonna stay with a friend tonight,” she said, tears running down her face.</p>
                <p>“Matilda come on, you’re being irrational, please don't do this.”</p>
                <p>“No Matthew, you are! You’re not you anymore. Your name doesn’t fool anyone and I know it doesn’t fool you. Matt is still in there, so stop trying to drown out his music! I can’t sit here and watch you aimlessly scroll through your blueprints anymore. When was the last time you even opened your guitar case?” Matthew turned his head down, his hand still on the mouse, compulsively scrolling. “I just… need some time to think,” Matilda said. She turned back to the dresser, picked up her purse and iPod, and pulled her headphones over her ears. “Now you can work in peace and quiet and hopefully make some progress,” she said, turning off the expensive stereo and walking to the front door. She paused while opening the door and said, “I really hope you’re happy Matthew.”</p>
                <p>“You know I’m not happy Matilda, that’s why I sit here and scroll. But look at the life I’ve made for us, the things we have,” Matthew said, gesturing around the loft.</p>
                <p>She stepped through the threshold and lingered, staring back at Matthew, who could only stare back. She released the door and let its weight slam it shut. The loft became completely silent and for the first time in years, Matt couldn’t stand it.</p>

                <p class="title">The Vinyl Revival</p>
                <p class="date">May 2015</p>   
                <p class="section-head">INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p class="section">Purpose</p>
                <p>The purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with an evaluation of the current popularity of vinyl records and the reasons people have returned to collecting physical versions of albums instead of buying music digitally. After reading this paper, the reader will understand how vinyl compares to other formats in the modern music industry, and will be informed enough to decide whether he would like to start a vinyl collection of his own.</p>
                <p class="section">Scope</p>
                <p>I begin the paper with a brief introduction to vinyl records and how they work. In the second section of this paper, I discuss the invention and history of vinyl records through the 20th Century. I highlight the dominance of vinyl until its rapid decline due to the invention the CD. I then discuss the rapid rise in vinyl sales that began in 2008. In the third section, I explore the myriad reasons that people are once more flocking to record stores, including industry gimmicks, increased social interaction while perusing and purchasing music, a psychological fascination with collecting physical items, and an alleged improvement in sound quality. In the fourth section, I note the obstacles facing vinyl sales and the ways vinyl pressers (the individuals responsible for fabricating the records) hope to deal with these obstacles. I conclude the paper with a broader look at the modern music industry and an evaluation of how vinyl may continue to play an important role as a competing format depending on how the general public, including the readers of this paper, decide to listen to their music.</p>
                <p class="section">Introduction to Vinyl</p>
                <p>Vinyl records are composed of polyvinyl chloride, a chemical compound that is a versatile and durable plastic, which is shaped into discs and imprinted with grooves. The grooves of vinyl records are formed through the translation of electrical impulses to an etching device, and these grooves are reverse translated by the needles of record players. Vinyl records are played on turntables, which are modern-day adaptations of the original gramophones (rudimentary, mechanical versions of modern turntables) present before the turn of the 19th Century. Modern turntables come in many designs and degrees of technological power. Some turntables can be purchased as stand-alone audio centers, which can read the grooves of the record, process the sounds, and also emit the sounds through speakers. Some minimalistic turntables, on the other hand, merely read the grooves of a record and require an external apparatus to emit sound.</p>
                <p class="section-head">THE RISE, FALL, AND REVIVAL OF VINYL</p>
                <p class="section">The Rise</p>
                <p>In the late 1800s, Emile Berliner created the direct precursor to modern turntables and vinyl records: the gramophone. Berliner’s gramophone played etched disks and ultimately became the foundation for modern-day vinyl records, though he used less technically advanced materials for his disks and players than we use today. The dominant method of listening to music closely followed Berliner’s gramophone model through most of the 20th Century. A grooved disk would be placed on a rotating table and a needle would read the grooves and translate them into amplified vibrations. As technology improved, the amplified vibrations were replaced with electrical impulses and the materials used for the disks and needles became more advanced. Despite the constant technological updates that vinyl records and turntables underwent throughout the 20th Century, they could not compete with digital media in the form of CDs. (Osborne 2014)</p>
                <p class="section">The Fall</p>
                <p>In the late 1980s, the music industry experienced a dramatic decline in vinyl record sales that coincided with the invention and popularization of CDs (Figure 1). Vinyl records were still being pressed, but CDs dominated the market. The public viewed CDs as an infallible format, and it was difficult for vinyl to compete. CDs were marketed as perfect, permanent, and compact, all of which vinyl records were not. Vinyl could be worn down through use, and it took up a large amount of space compared to CDs. Most of all, vinyl was imperfect and had static, dust, and scratches. CD sales were remarkably high in the 1990s and still make up a sizeable percentage of all music sales today. (Hogan 2014)</p>
                <p class="section">The Revival</p>
                <p>When digital downloads, digital streaming, and pirating became popular, the death of the CD seemed to be rapidly approaching, so the fact that vinyl records experienced drastically increased sales starting in 2008 came as a shock. Vinyl sales in 2008 almost doubled from the previous year, and since then, sales have continued to climb at impressive rates. In 2013, 6.1 million vinyl albums were sold, which marked a six-fold increase from the 1 million vinyl albums sold in 2007 (Oliphint 2014). These numbers are impressive, but in actuality, vinyl sales still only constitute about two percent of the total industry sales (Figures 2 and 3). Even if the percentage of sales is small, the music industry cannot disregard the statistically significant increases in sales, and therefore we must examine why people are once more purchasing vinyl (Shah 2014).</p>
                <p class="section-head">WHY ARE PEOPLE BUYING VINYL?</p>
                <p class="section">The Individualism of Gimmicks and Special Offers</p>
                <p>Vinyl pressers are churning out an unprecedented variety and quantity of specialized records, unlike the industry has ever experienced. The presentation and packaging of records has dramatically changed since the heyday of vinyl. Vinyl pressers used to be able to churn out hundreds of standard, black, polyvinyl chloride records, one after the next, and quickly slide them into their uniform sleeves. Of course, there were always some promotional or artistic gimmicks for some of the most prominent bands and albums. The difference in the modern vinyl industry is that every band, regardless of their popularity, seems to want to print their album in wide arrays of colors, and demands that eye-catching inserts like stickers and download cards be placed in every record sleeve (Khanna 2014). Some artists are even asking for records that include glitter, coffee grounds, ashes of a bible, and even their own blood, but vinyl pressers generally refuse the requests for blood (Oliphint 2014).</p>
                <p>The increase in promotional gimmicks is changing the landscape of vinyl retail, and the success of such gimmicks suggests something very important about public consumerism - the modern vinyl consumer is looking for more than just a way to listen to music. A vinyl consumer in the modern age is looking for an aesthetic, physical testament to his or her unique brand of fandom, and artists are trying to capitalize on this desire by offering limited-time promotional deals and diverse prints of their albums (Khanna 2014). The success of these unique, limited- time offers may suggest that people have a psychological fascination with individualism. However, at the same time, people are finding a great deal of value in the sense of community fostered by record purchasing and record stores.</p>
                <p class="section">Record Store Day and the Social Culture of Collecting</p>
                <p>When digital downloads became the norm, the social culture of purchasing music completely changed, and people have made impressive efforts to reestablish the social culture of vinyl stores. People are now able to buy any song in the world without ever having to leave their home, which means that they might be missing out on meaningful conversations with fellow record store patrons and employees. In an attempt to reclaim the social culture of buying music, a conglomeration of independent storeowners and employees founded Record Store Day in 2007 and held the first one in April of 2008. Record Store Day is an international campaign that seeks to bring attention to the still flourishing culture of independent record stores around the world. For one day every year, the music industry focuses its attention on vinyl records and the stores that specialize in selling them. Stores hold performances and offer special deals, and artists release limited-edition records to help garner media and consumer attention. (Record Store Day 2015)</p>
                <p>Record Store Day has been very successful, though the success is not due solely to the intense media coverage. In fact, between 2013 and 2014 there was a 50% increase in sales on Record Store Day alone (G.M. 2014). One could argue that the media presence of Record Store Day is enough to cause such heightened interest in vinyl however, René de Guzman, the curator of a vinyl exhibit at the Museum of California, attributes the surging interest in vinyl and the success of Record Store Day to something more: “There’s a social aspect of listening to records. You share musical interests and let others know the reasons why certain things are meaningful to you and others. Listening to records puts music into the foreground because its physical nature requires intention and attention” (G.M. 2014). Record Store Day has been a successful tool in</p>
                <p>rekindling the social culture of buying music, but it is, after all, only one day a year. Mr. Guzman is correct in noting the importance of the social culture and the forced attention of listening to analog records, and in fact, many aficionados treat their records in a highly attentive, almost ritualistic way.</p>
                <p class="section">The Ritual of Collecting and Putting Needle to Groove</p>
                <p>Clicking around a screen can feel simplistic and unfulfilling compared to the robust and personal experience of playing a record. As noted by Mr. Guzman in the quotation in Section 3.2, playing a record requires a great deal of focus and attention, and is a process that can be enjoyed in and of itself. Vinyl records can be smelled, touched, and physically admired; they are more substantive and infinitely more tangible than the cluster of pixels on a screen displaying album art that is too small to appreciate.</p>
                <p>The popularity of digital media has meant that people have no longer been forming a music collection that feels as definitive and personal as an analog collection. Despite the fact that iTunes allows people to amass a collection of files, and Spotify allows people to click a button and save an album to a digital library, the ease with which songs and albums can be added and deleted has undermined the value of the library. A vinyl record is a work of art, something that can be hung on your wall or proudly displayed on a shelf. Vinyl records provide people with a way of tangibly declaring their fandom, and they serve as trophies because they show that a person has made the effort to walk to the store and spend upwards of twenty dollars to purchase a product from a beloved artist. Just as collecting vinyl records and perusing a vinyl library are deeply swayed by ritual and familiarity, so too is the actual audio experience of listening to a vinyl record. (Oliphint 2014)</p>
                <p class="section">The Allegedly Superior Sound Quality</p>
                <p>Many individuals, in addition to relishing the act of playing a vinyl record, are convinced that they sound significantly better than any digital format available. When mp3s first appeared, the sampling rate (the digital approximation of an analog sound wave) was low, and thus the sound quality was very poor. Sampling rates were kept low for the sake of convenience and saving space in computer storage, but the poor quality convinced people that all digital audio sounded cheap and grainy (Richardson 2013). This belief is simply untrue. Higher sampling rate mp3s are the standard now, and beyond mp3s, lossless files (compressed files that can be uncompressed without any loss of data) such as FLAC and WAV files are becoming increasingly popular. Some of the lossless files are so detailed that they actually surpass the level at which humans are able to perceive differences in sound quality. If digital files are so advanced that their flaws are imperceptible to the human ear, how can one possibly make the claim that vinyl sounds better? In actuality, vinyl does not produce inherently higher quality audio, in fact, vinyl audio is generally lower quality, but can actually sound more pleasing to an individual.</p>
                <p>Hearing is a highly subjective experience, and no matter how much people use science to prove that digital audio can be considered perfect to the human ear, some individuals still insist that they prefer listening to vinyl because it simply sounds better to them. Most people cite the familiar and comforting static associated with playing a vinyl record. This static is, in fact, a blatant distortion of what was originally intended for the music. Another common praise of vinyl is the warmth of the sound. <span>Warmth </span>is a commonly used, vague, and poorly understood term. The alleged warmth is actually just the result of vinyl records being unable to precisely process the bass tones, which results in a distortion of the original sound. Aspects of vinyl such as static</p>
                <p>and warmth make it of technically lower sound quality, but if someone likes the warmth and static, the vinyl recording will sound better to him or her than the digital one. (Richardson 2013)</p>
                <p class="section-head">OBSTACLES FACING THE VINYL REVIVAL</p>
                <p class="section">Limited Resources for Production</p>
                <p>With the sudden surge in demand for vinyl records and the yearly spike in orders for Record Store Day, vinyl pressing plants are facing high demand that they are unprepared for, which has severely strained their operations. In fact, demand has become so high that artists are frequently left without any vinyl records to sell at their record release events. Artists that have always ordered vinyl are ordering more, and artists that have never expressed interest in vinyl are now submitting large orders of their own. To make matters more trying, as discussed in Section 3.1, an ever-increasing amount of specialized orders are adding complexity to the already hectic operations of pressing plants. (Khanna 2014)</p>
                <p>Only about twenty fully functional pressing plants are still in operation in the United States. Many have gone out of business since the vinyl heyday, and since then, few others have opened. Most of the remaining vinyl presses have been bought and refurbished, and no one is manufacturing new presses, so some people speculate that the vinyl production industry may soon reach its ceiling. To add to difficulties facing pressing plants, vinyl presses are complex machines and require well-trained professionals to run them. Everyone who knows how to use a press is already operating one, and with business booming, pressers have no time to train new employees. Even more important is that vinyl production takes more than just a professional; it takes an artist. (Khanna 2014)</p>
                <p class="section">Artistic Nature of Production</p>
                <p>Part of what makes vinyl pressing so difficult is that vinyl pressing, unlike CD manufacturing, is much more of an art than an easily reproducible science. Every aspect of a vinyl record is vital, and every step of the process is prone to error. Whether it is the vinyl disk, the groove etchings, the paper label, or the sleeve, every aspect of the finished product involves a human touch. No matter how consistent machine settings might be, pressers can never be sure that the product will turn out the same each time. Even on the musician’s end of the process, vinyl requires a great deal more understanding than other formats. Music must be properly edited for vinyl in a way that is distinctly different than for CDs, and musicians must understand that the pressing procedure is not as fast as duplicating a CD or uploading a digital file. Creating a vinyl record is a lengthy and personal procedure, and vinyl production is certainly slowed by the meticulousness of the process, however this attention to detail is part of what makes vinyl so special. Vinyl records are the finished product of artists that work in different mediums that add to and adapt one another’s work, taking nothing and turning it into sound, and taking sound and turning it into grooves. (Oliphint 2014)</p>
                <p class="section-head">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                <p>With the music industry very much in the throes of the vinyl revival, everyone is eagerly waiting to see how the vinyl industry continues to change. Some people propose that the format will just continue regaining popularity and eventually the pressing plants will catch up with demand by increasing employment or contracting new presses. Others suggest that we may soon reach the ceiling on vinyl production, and the revival will ultimately stagnate, which would leave vinyl to occupy a meager 2% of industry sales. Vinyl will likely never be able to replace the convenience of streaming services such as Spotify or Pandora, but perhaps people will start to develop a dualistic approach to building a music library. Perhaps people will begin digitally streaming for convenience in addition to collecting some of their favorite records on vinyl. A dualistic approach to listening to music would allow individuals to have the expansive connectivity of streaming services at their fingertips while still feeling tangibly tied to the artists they love most.</p>
                <p class="section-head">RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                <p>Whatever the future may hold for vinyl, clearly vinyl records are a remarkably tenacious music format that will likely never fully disappear. That said, vinyl will likely never again dominate the market as it once did. Is vinyl a better format than CDs, digital downloads, or streaming services? Ultimately, the question of which format is best is a very personal question that every individual must ask him or herself. After reading this paper, you should have a better idea of how vinyl records came to occupy their current position in the music industry, and you should understand why many people find value in starting or growing their vinyl collection. If you think you might like to start your own collection, go to a record store and see if they have a demo turntable. See how it feels to manually place the record on the turntable and place the needle in the groove. You might just fall in love like so many have before.</p>

                <p class="title">This Song Takes Me Back:<br>Evaluating the Efficacy of Music Therapy on Alzheimer's Patients</p>
                <p class="date">May 2014</p>
                <p>In 2014, we still have no cure for Alzheimer’s and merely have side-effect riddled countermeasures, but it is absolutely imperative that science continues to find measures to mitigate and eventually cure the affliction. Alzheimer’s Disease affects over five million Americans, accounting for almost 500,000 deaths each year as the 6th leading cause of death in the nation.<a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_facts_and_figures.asp#prevalence"><span class="footnote">1</span></a> The physical, mental, and emotional traumas caused by Alzheimer’s are ravaging and heartbreaking, and the disease is too frequently pushed to the wayside due to its prevalence in the elderly, despite the presence of roughly 200,000 individuals under the age of 65 afflicted with early onset Alzheimer’s.<a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_facts_and_figures.asp#prevalence"><span class="footnote">1</span></a> Since heightened research began on the matter in the late 1980’s, it has been proven that music therapy can have very notable clinical benefits in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease. It has been a difficult task for researchers to pinpoint the exact neurological mechanisms through which music therapy assists patients because the neurological dystrophy makes it very challenging for patients to engage in customary research measurements. In addition, there is limited knowledge of the neural networks through which music can affect the brain, making it very difficult to pinpoint the underlying mechanisms of how music therapy can assist patients. Despite this, progress is continually being made and it has become clear that music seems to resonate with portions of the brain that are otherwise lost to Alzheimer’s. While music may not be the ultimate cure for the disease, we must continue gathering data on its effects and the mechanisms through which it assists patients. The study of music therapy and its effects on patients with Alzheimer’s can unequivocally shed some light into how we might one day find a cure, and at the very least it can be used as a supplemental treatment and a tool that can help ease the horrors of the disease and assist with communication, mood enhancement and regulation, and potentially even memory.</p>
                <p>Alzheimer’s Disease is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia in which the neurons in the brain fall into increasingly intense states of disrepair as the patient ages with the disease. It is characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques caused by increased levels of the beta-amyloid protein outside neurons and the tau protein inside neurons.<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.02.001"><span class="footnote">2</span></a> The increased presence of these two proteins overtakes the neurons and causes them to disconnect from one another and ultimately die, resulting in the widespread loss of neural mass as well as the accumulation of dead cell matter.<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.02.001"><span class="footnote">2</span></a> A particularly frustrating facet of Alzheimer’s Disease is that it is generally difficult to diagnose as well as treat due to the irregular manner in which it can affect patients in addition to the long period of time over which Alzheimer’s takes hold. While the most general sign of Alzheimer’s is the presence of intense memory loss and the inability to learn new things, many other functional parts of the brain can experience deterioration such as the centers responsible for language, spatial conception, judgement, and mood regulation.<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.02.001"><span class="footnote">2</span></a> To make diagnosis and treatment even more difficult, these traits are also common among a great deal of other forms of dementia including, but not limited to, stroke induced dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s Disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.02.001"><span class="footnote">2</span></a></p>
                <p>Despite modern evidence of its efficacy, music therapy as a clinical practice is still constantly facing the difficult task of differentiating itself from other, less professionally demanding forms of therapy such as pet therapy. In the early phases of experimentation with music therapy, the rationalization of its implementation was anything but scientific, relying heavily on anecdotal and observational evidence. As research evolved and gained legitimacy, the earlier forays into the field were most concerned with facilitating communication and socialization, which is a primary concern in Alzheimer’s patients since they frequently experience increased agitation in addition to a severely diminished ability to both articulate and comprehend verbal interactions depending on the stage of their disease. In a 1995 study, 19 Alzheimer’s patients were observed to gauge the reactions of patients in different stages of cognitive deterioration to twice weekly, 60 minute music sessions over the course of six weeks (Sambandham &amp; Schirm, 1995). The findings of the study suggested a very wide range in responses to the music therapy sessions and ultimately it failed in elucidating very much of a pattern in the patients’ animation, verbalization, and behavior, resulting in a conclusion that the memory inhibitions of the patients nullified the long term effects of the music therapy. That said, the patients did tend to appear notably more relaxed during the sessions and more social with the other patients in the 20 minute observation periods following the therapy sessions, including the exhibition of more societally appropriate interactions. Also of note was that the memory and “reminiscent” capabilities of the most severely afflicted patients improved immediately following the sessions, though there was some doubt as to the sufficiency of memory measurement as well as the question of interference of rare and somewhat inexplicable occurrences of “periods of lucidity.” While ultimately the clinical ramifications remained a mystery in this early study, the resounding conclusion of the paper was that the “findings add to the knowledge that music can be a positive intervention, capable of reaching the inner core of the individual to reaffirm humanness and self-worth” (Sambandham &amp; Schirm, 1995).</p>
                <p>As life expectancy and geriatric population continued to rise as time passed, the Alzheimer’s crisis gained public exposure and the search for cures and therapies gained speed. Sambandham &amp; Schirm’s conclusion that music can be a way to, at the very least, “minimize the tragedy of the disease” (Sambandham &amp; Schirm, 1995) garnered more widespread interest as research pressed on. In a 1998 meta analysis of research conducted since 1985, an attempt was made to minimize and overcome the limitations of the “qualitative nature…and methodological variability” of the burgeoning field and try to better understand the ideal conditions to maximize effectiveness of treatment (Koger et al., 1998). The synthesis of information corroborated those found in Sabandham &amp; Schirm’s study, making note that overall there seemed to be a significant improvement of patient mood and agitation, as well as a positive effect on their communicative abilities regarding group socialization and cognizant vocalization. Despite these trends, ubiquitous and specific factors which promote amelioration of Alzheimer’s effects remained unidentifiable, the study citing the fact that efficacy was highly dependent on the receptiveness of individual patients to specific types of music exposure. Additionally, while it was not able to define a relationship between treatment length and its longterm effectiveness, this was attributed to the limitations of the studies involved in their meta analysis due to the fact that observation periods usually immediately followed the therapy sessions. The study concluded with a description of future proposals to improve research validity such as the inclusion of “blind” data collectors, the direct juxtaposition of multiple kinds of music exposure, the further exploration into the neurology of the underlying mechanisms through which music therapy affects patients, a more careful classification of the stage and type of dementia in subjects, and the long term observation and analysis of potential effects.</p>
                <p>The following year saw the inclusion of some of the advice suggested by Koger et al. (1998) in a 1999 study done on the different effects of “individualized versus classical ‘relaxation’ music” on agitation caused by Alzheimer’s related dementia (Gerdner, 1999). The goal of the study was to find a healthy and federally acceptable method of coping with the agitation as opposed to the restraint and chemical based solutions previously used, and to mitigate the restrictions of the limited number of caretakers available in the workforce. Combining the knowledge that Alzheimer’s seems to leave music processing systems intact despite the deterioration of language processing, and the fact that distant memories remain vivid despite the inability of patients to retain recent information, the study implemented an 18 week program in which two groups of patients were exposed to both individualized music geared toward activating their earliest and strongest memories as well as generic classical music with a two week washout period between the exposures. Both quantitative and qualitative measurements were conducted, and both suggested that individualized music (usually suggested by family members of the patients) drastically decreased the rate of agitated behavior, significantly more so than did the classical music. Despite quantitative corroboration of music therapy’s efficacy, the truly astounding results come from specific cases and instances. Individualized treatment was so potent that it was able to make one patient go from begging for death and lashing out at her roommate to smiling, and it was even able to evoke specific memories of people and occurrences from early life in other patients. While the study’s findings were limited to the homogenous caucasian sample, it again exhibits just how beneficial music therapy (individualized music therapy in particular) can be in the lives of patients, families, and caretakers. The wonder of music therapy is that, while the benefits are by no means unanimous, there is almost no risk in at least attempting implementation. If for whatever reason (such as the instigation of bad memories or very rare cases of music induced epilepsy (Fukui, Arai, &amp; Toyoshima, 2012)) the patient reacts negatively, the music can simply be stopped and not reimplemented. However, if a patient responds with a smile, or a reminiscence, or even the retraction of a death wish, music therapy can be easily included in the daily lives of these patients.</p>
                <p>While observational studies and case studies have continued through the 21st century, an increased presence of neurological studies has arisen in the new millennium. For example, in a 2008 paper a theory that music affects the steroid hormone levels in the brain resulting in increased neurogenesis and neural plasticity was extensively explored (Fukui &amp; Toyoshima, 2008). The presence of increased levels of cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen have been proven to help facilitate communicative strength in a plethora of different animal species, and in humans it is known that cognition and memory are both affected by the presence of these steroids, and they are directly involved in stress management, neurogenesis, and the protection of neural networks. In a followup study in 2012, this theory was taken to the field and saliva samples were collected in order to measure hormone secretions of patients before and after music therapy sessions (Fukui, Arai, &amp; Toyoshima, 2012). The results corroborated much of the prior theorizing and found that music therapy incited increased levels of testosterone and 17ß- estradiol, both of which have been reported to mitigate neuronal degeneration. The study also provided insight into the most effective ways to administer treatment. While music alone promoted hormonal health, music combined with the presence of a music therapy professional resulted in far more potent effects. The results of this study are crucial, as the use of hormone supplements to ease the effects of the disease has met with success, but the side effects make the option less than ideal, resulting in tragedies such as breast cancer and stroke. Music on the other hand is inexpensive, widely available, and very rarely detrimental to a patient’s health and wellbeing. Due to the immense power of these steroids and music’s ability to regulate their secretion, it seems as though music may not only be a means of alleviating the horrors of severe Alzheimer’s, but it may also be instrumental in delaying the onset of the disease.</p>
                <p>In addition to the analysis and synthesis of research done on neurological hormone levels and music’s effect on them, advancement in brain imaging technology has helped to facilitate a more purely scientific examination of the effects of music on Alzheimer’s affected brains. In a 2011 study, differences between Alzheimer’s patients and analogous control subjects were examined, and the different responses to familiar and non-familiar music were explored using fMRI (Jacova et al., 2011). The results suggested that Alzheimer’s patients have “differential neural recruitment with respect to preserved music recognition” and the new knowledge of how different familiarities of music affect regions such as the lingual gyrus, the left inferior parietal, the left superior, and striatum could be invaluable in further refining how music is used as a clinical tool. As technology continues to improve, studies that use brain imaging techniques may be vital in understanding how Alzheimer’s riddled brains differ from normal brain in how they process music. Understanding the mysterious mechanisms through which music resonates with Alzheimer’s patients may be a key step in finding methods to delay or even halt the onset of the disease, and perhaps it may even lend a clue as to how it may be cured.</p>
                <p>With the field now populated by both observational and scientifically analytical evidence supporting music therapy as a very viable and effective treatment, research has begun to move away from purely behavioral effects and change its focus to a deeper look into one of the most troubling and elusive aspects of Alzheimer’s: the widespread loss of memory capabilities. Utilizing novel melodies as well as nonsense words, a 2009 study sought to test the strength of musical and verbal short term and long term memory in an Alzheimer’s population versus in a control population (Ménard &amp; Belleville, 2009). The findings suggested that Alzheimer’s patients experience a decline in their musical and verbal memory, both in the short and long term, and that perhaps music and verbal short term memory share some neural networks, though this was not corroborated or supported by any findings regarding long term memory. While these findings seem to suggest that music may not be as efficacious as we might hope, they also do not account for the utilization of music from an individual’s past. To a small degree this study dissociates itself from being applied to music therapy as a whole due to the use of novel melodies rather than an individualized repertoire. As Gerdner (1999) suggested, individualized music has been empirically shown to have a greater effect on behavioral traits of Alzheimer’s patients, so this may also translate to their internal neurology as well. In addition, there is some potential promise to the suggestion that musical and verbal memory share a number of neural networks. This overlap could be a blessing or a curse, the implications either being that since verbal memory is known to be in a deficit, so too must be musical memory, or that music may provide us with a key to accessing the shared paths in order to bolster both forms of memory, though more studies are needed to corroborate either of these potentialities.</p>
                <p>In the following year, a 2010 study embarked on a similar mission to determine whether verbal cues could be better encoded in Alzheimer’s patients when the words were associated with music, utilizing the knowledge that verbal and musical memory seem to share common neural networks (Simmons-Stern et al., 2010). Patients and control subjects were presented with a spoken and sung version of numerous multi line lyrics from children’s songs, with which they were reportedly unfamiliar prior to experimentation. While Alzheimer’s patients expectedly performed far poorer than did the control subjects when asked to recall the presented lyrics, the results of the combinative effects of verbal and musical encoding resulted in a significant increase in Alzheimer’s patients’ ability to recall the lyrics as opposed to when they were merely presented with spoken words. Their accuracy increased from 28% to 40%, no small feat for individuals who are forced to struggle with the limiting effects of Alzheimer’s on a daily basis. What really makes this impressive is that similar results were not found in the control group who actually experienced a minor decrease in recall ability (from 77% to 74%, which was considered statistically insignificant), suggesting that something very unique is occurring in the patients’ brains. Speculation exists that the bolstering effect of music on Alzheimer’s patients’ memory is due to the slower decay of brain regions commonly associated with music processing (such as the basal ganglia, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and others (Simmons-Stern et al., 2010)) as compared with the regions associated with general memory. Another theory is that music helps to direct the attention of Alzhiemer’s patients, which would facilitate better encoding of information, and that the music may contribute to general arousal which could generally enhance the neurological processes associated with verbal encoding. While the true mechanism through which this enhancement occurs is not known, the findings of Simmons-Stern et al. without a doubt provide very compelling evidence suggesting the efficacy of music and music therapy as tools for assisting patients in ways that surpass temporary behavioral effects and in fact permeate deep neurological networks that are otherwise lost to the disease.</p>
                <p>Clearly music therapy is still a developing field in which much more research is necessary, but over the course of the last three decades, leaps and bounds have been made in the study of behavioral and neurological effects of music and music therapy on patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease. Despite medicine’s immense expansion and progression, we are still far from finding a cure to this destructive disease, so it is absolutely imperative that we continue to explore the mechanisms through which Alzheimer’s affects the brain, and music has much promise as a potential lost link in solving the riddles of the disease. The horrors of Alzheimer’s affect not only the patients, but also their families, caretakers, and other residents of care facilities. So long as the cure continues to elude us, we must at the very least make efforts to ease the horrors of the disease. Music therapy has been proven time and time again to mitigate patients’ intense agitation, improve communicative abilities, and even promote fond reminiscence. Evidence has also been collected suggesting the promotion of vital neurological hormones that may be key in protecting and maybe even regenerating portions of the brain’s neural networks that are continually damaged by Alzheimer’s. Modern research is even suggesting that music therapy may be key in helping patients learn and recall new information. While music therapy in its current stages is still far from providing us with a cure, it is clear that it is an invaluable tool in improving the quality of life of patients and those close to them, and as research continues it may even provide us with a vital stepping stone in the creation of a cure for this horrible disease.</p>
